## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
vNum1 <- c(-1,5)
vNum2 <- c(2,3)
vNum3 <- c(vNum1,vNum2)
vNum4 <- c(-1,5,2,3)
vNum5 <- c(c(-1,5),c(2,3))
```
```{r}
char1<-"你好"
char2<-'你好'
```
```{r}
library(httr)
library(dplyr)
GET("https://api.github.com/repos/tpemartin/108-2-56-inclass-practice/commits") %>%
  content() %>%
  View()
```


```{r}
char1Vector<-c("你好","How are you?")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
